# YOLO Object Detection with Tonic and FastAPI

## üìù Overview

This project implements real-time object detection using a YOLO model, a Rust gRPC service (Tonic + Ort)
for inference, and a FastAPI-based middleware that streams video from a webcam or file,
collects predictions, and serves them via an API.
A simple HTML page is available to visualize the detections live.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  - Rust ([Tonic], [Ort]) for running YOLO model inference via gRPC using [ONNX] runtime
  - [FastAPI] (Python) for handling video streaming and API requests
  - [OpenCV] for processing video frames in the middleware
  - HTML + JavaScript for real-time visualization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

## Ô∏èüì¶ Installation

To run the project, simply execute the following command at the root directory:

```bash
make all
```

This will download the necessary images and automatically open a webpage for visualization.

## üêß OS Compatibility

Currently, the project only works on Linux as it relies on mounting the `/dev/video1` device.
If you are using a different video input, you may need to modify the source code accordingly.
