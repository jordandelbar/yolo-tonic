# YOLO Object Detection with Tonic and Axum

## üìù Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection pipeline using a YOLO v8 model. A Rust-based gRPC service (using Tonic and Ort) handles inference, while an Axum-based middleware streams video from a webcam, collects predictions, and serves them via WebSocket. Additionally, a simple HTML page is provided for live visualization of the detections, and a predict_image POST endpoint allows direct inference on JPEG images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  - [Tonic], [Ort] for running YOLO model inference via gRPC using [ONNX] runtime
  - [Axum], [Tonic] for handling video streaming and client Http requests
  - [OpenCV] for processing video frames in the middleware
  - HTML + JavaScript for real-time visualization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

## Ô∏èüì¶ Installation

To run the project, simply execute the following command at the root directory:

```sh
make all
```

This will download the necessary images, runs the service and automatically
open a webpage for visualization.

## ‚ö° Running with CUDA and TensorRT support

If you have [set up CUDA correctly](docs/setup/nvidia_docker.md), you can run the project with GPU acceleration by executing:

```sh
make all-cuda
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performances
![Alt text](./docs/images/performances.png)

The system is designed for real-time processing using parallel inference sessions to maximize throughput.

* **TensorRT**: The time taken to generate predictions for a single frame is typically around **42ms** (median) and **90ms** (99th percentile). This means the detections you see correspond to the video frame from approximately 42/90ms prior.

* **CPU**: The time taken to generate predictions for a single frame is typically around **250ms** (median) and **450ms** (99th percentile). This means the detections you see correspond to the video frame from approximately 250/450ms prior.

This, of course, depends on the hardware you run and the results obtained here are on a RTX2060 with 8gb of VRAM for the TensorRT part and an Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-9600K √ó 6 for the CPU part.

## üêß OS Compatibility

Currently, the project only works on Linux as it relies on mounting the `/dev/video1` device.
If you are using a different video input, you may need to modify the source code accordingly.
