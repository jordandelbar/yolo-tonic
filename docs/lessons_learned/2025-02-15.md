# Performance Trade-off: Streaming vs. Synchronized Predictions

While streaming offered the potential for near real-time predictions,
the observed desynchronization between the prediction and video streams
negatively impacted performance and usability. We had to discard frames,
resulting in a drop in effective frames per second (FFPS) event without
making any model prediction.

A less frequent ping approach provided a better balance, prioritizing
synchronization and visual consistency over minimizing latency.
Indeed, predicting every frame is unnecessary for objects
moving too slowly to disappear within 1/24 of a second.

Other that that: gRPC rules.

# Working with opencv in Rust is a real pain
Integrating OpenCV with Rust proved significantly more complex than anticipated.
Difficulties arose primarily from managing dependencies

Solution for now: using the [image](https://docs.rs/image/latest/image/) crate
